## Current phase
research (increment A Live bots, Large; scope approved REDUCE) - PROCESS.md section 3.

## Goal (one sentence)
A public HTTPS MCP bridge (Python, deployed on Coolify at chats.rmlab.cloud) that lets Grok Bots read and post in Rob's self-hosted Mattermost, each bot using its own Mattermost bot token.

## Active slice
none (D hardening [done](thoughts/shared/slices/2026-10-26-d-hardening-xff-bearer.md))

## Next action
A Live bots: scope recorded REDUCE + defer A5 (one bot; A1, A2, A3 own-post, A4, A7, A8; hand-set channel list). Research written: [thoughts/shared/research/2026-10-26-live-bots-current-code.md](thoughts/shared/research/2026-10-26-live-bots-current-code.md). Awaiting Rob CP-R, then eng-architecture-review (new ADR for encrypted token store + security review at CP-B). No code for A yet.

## Blockers
none

## Pending approvals
