# PROJECT_STATE

> Single entry point. Any agent reads THIS file first, then the latest handoff linked below.
> Update it at the end of every session. Keep it under one screen.

## Current phase
discover - entry/exit criteria in `.eng/PROCESS.md` section 3.

## Goal (one sentence)
A public HTTPS MCP bridge (Python, deployed on Coolify at chats.rmlab.cloud) that lets Grok Bots read and post in Rob's self-hosted Mattermost, each bot using its own Mattermost bot token.

## Active slice
none

## Next action
Rob reviews docs/design/2026-10-25-mmbridge-mcp.md at CP-A (approve problem, REQ-1..8, acceptance examples). After approval: eng-scope-review.

## Blockers
none

## Pending approvals
See `pending_approvals` in the front matter (the only copy; `.eng/bin/eng-status` renders it). Do not list items here.
